# RAviz
RAviz is a visualization tool, which can be used for showing genomic alignments (the format should be paf). Furthermore, it can also be utilized for visualizing rare k-mers and alignment results, simultaneously. This function will play important roles in T2T (Telomere to Telomere) assembly. Note: if you want to showing rare k-mers, you need to run the pre-processing program (can be downloaded from https://github.com/xianjia10/kmer-map.git) of RAviz to generate the input file of RAviz. Moreover, the testing data is a big file, which was hard to upload into the github webisite. Therefore, if users want to test the funtions of RAviz using testing data, please decompress the data before using it.
